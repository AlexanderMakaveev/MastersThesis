# MastersThesis
My Master's (Part II) thesis as a Chemistry student at the University of Oxford. Work completed in the 2022/2023 academic year under the supervision of Professors Fernanda Duarte and Edward Anderson. The thesis was awarded a First Class (72%).

## Summary

We present a computational and experimental investigation into the mechanism
of an apparent inverse electron demand [4 + 2] cycloaddition followed by a SO<sub>2</sub>
cheletropic extrusion in a cascade manner. The reaction is proposed to proceed
via an ambimodal transition state, followed by a minimum energy path bifurcation
allowing for the formation of both a normal and an inverse electron demand adduct.
This transformation was reported in a study by the Duarte and Anderson groups,
and used for the collective synthesis of a family of sesquiterpenes.
This work employs computational and physical organic chemistry methods to
further study the mechanism of this cycloaddition. We report quantum mechanical
computations that support the ambimodal hypothesis and give new information
on the Cope rearrangement that connects the two adducts. Ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations confirm the bipericyclic nature of the transition state, and
provide novel insight into the selectivity and asynchronicity of the reaction. Finally,
we report the results from a <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C kinetic isotope effect experiment, which
support the ambimodality hypothesis by ruling out alternative mechanisms, such
as a stepwise addition or a regular [4 + 2] cycloaddition.
